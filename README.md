# My Flask App

This is a Flask application that serves as a template for building web applications.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `app/__init__.py`: This file is the initialization file for the Flask application. It creates an instance of the Flask app and sets up the necessary configurations.

- `app/routes.py`: This file contains the route definitions for the Flask app. It defines the URL endpoints and the corresponding functions to handle the requests.

- `app/models.py`: This file contains the models or data structures used in the Flask app. It defines the database tables, fields, and relationships if applicable.

- `app/templates/base.html`: This file is a template file written in HTML. It serves as the base template for other HTML templates in the Flask app. It can contain common elements like the header, footer, and navigation bar.

- `venv/`: This directory is typically used to store the virtual environment for the project. It contains the Python interpreter and installed packages specific to this project.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python packages and their versions required for the project. It is used by the package manager to install the necessary dependencies.

## Installation

To run the Flask app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-flask-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-flask-app`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the Flask development server: `flask run`

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
